# Flajolet-Martin-AMS-implementation
This repository contains a notebook with the implementations of the Flajolet-Martin algorithms to estiamte the number of distinct elements, and the Alon-Matias-Szegedy algorithm to estimate moments.
There is also a report that describes the algorithms and the experiments conducted with the implementations.
A Colab version of the notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a39GNlAYE4F9jnrm9oDdr5u5aRErQwf7?usp=sharing). To execute the notebook it is necessary to set the kaggle api key in the first cell, as the algorithms are tested on the Letterboxd dataset.
